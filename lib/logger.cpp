    * For example, if the user tries to access a folder that does not exist, the
    * function will only return false, because it is printed this way.
    * To find out exactly what happened, you can use the logger's "information" variable.
    *

    * This level records information that may cause the program to crash.

    * through cerr and the log level will be marked.
    * Due to the limited level of the author, errors of this level are 
    * almost never caught. QAQ
